# How to Add the Hero Background Image

1. Save the storefront image you just shared to:
   `/Users/chasemorgan/themerchantguide/static/images/hero-bg.jpg`

2. Or drag and drop the image into the `static/images/` folder and rename it to `hero-bg.jpg`

3. The CSS is already set up with a strong dark overlay (85% opacity) to ensure the white text is readable over the image.

4. If the text still isn't readable enough, we can:
   - Increase the overlay opacity
   - Add text shadows
   - Adjust the gradient colors

The current setup includes:
- Dark olive overlay (85% opacity)
- Fallback gradient background
- Proper background sizing and positioning
